# Academic research
This repository contains writings on various topics of NLP and computer science.

It is organized by whether a work was a conference presentation, my thesis, peer-reviewed publication, or unpublished research.

Some of the highlights include 
- `.Peer-reviewed publications/ACM/A Fast Filtering Algorithm for Massive Context-free Grammars.pdf`
- `./Unpublished research projects/2018/Interfacing Systemic Functional Grammars with Frame Semantics.pdf`
- `./Unpublished research projects/2020/Generating novel fruits from text descriptions using Variational Autoencoders.pdf`
- `./Unpublished research projects/2020/Perfectly_Private_Contact_Tracing.pdf`

and most importantly

- `./Undergraduate Thesis/full.pdf`

## The complete table of contents is below:

- **SynId: A hybrid approach to semantic word similarity for use in Automated Essay Scoring (AES) software (2016)**
 
    A description of a semantic similarity algorithm for use in AES

- **Cruciform: Solving Crosswords with Natural Language Processing (2016)**

    A technical description of a system for automated crossword puzzle solving.

- **Discourse planning as a transformational process (2018)**

    A high level model of integrating compiled knowledge and reasoning to perform discourse planning.

- **Frame semantics and the derivational process in English (2018, presented at the Cornell Undergraduate Linguistics Colloquium)**

    A poster describing content similar to that in "Discourse planning as a transformational process"

- **Analyzing interest in naval development across regions and over time using Chinese newswire data (2018)**

    Written for `GOV 1982: Chinese Foreign Policy 1949-Present` on an analysis of the relationship between trends in state run media and strategic actions taken by the Chinese military. China.zip is the data corresponding to that paper


- **Interfacing Systemic Functional Grammars with Frame Semantics (2018, presented at the ISFC @ Boston College)**

    Describes efforts to integrate conventional AI knowledge representation with classical constraint grammars

- **Interfacing Systemic Functional Grammars with Frame Semantics (2018, paper)**
   
    Describes efforts to integrate conventional AI knowledge representation with classical constraint grammars

- **On the Expressiveness of Systemic Functional Grammars (2018)**

    A Proof showing that Systemic Functional Grammars are equivalent in expressiveness to Context-free Grammars and are thus parseable in polynomial time
    

- **Using spin glass models to simulate linguistic change in speech communities (2018)**

    A computational modeling study conducted for the course `APMATH254: Information Processing and Statistical Physics` which treats linguistic change as a result of accomodative and dissociative pressures on individuals resulting from in-group/out-group formations and models the resulting population dynamics using spin-glass models and simulated annealing.

- **Algorithmic and Information Theoretic Decoding Thresholds for Low Density Parity-Check Code (2018)**
    
    A primer written for `CS229r: Advanced Topics in Computer Science` on using belief propagation to construct error correcting codes, as well an algorithmic and information theoretic explanation for the noise thresholds at which error correction becomes impossible.

- **Intelligent agents can develop good policies for exploiting large data sets (2019)**

    A reinforcement learning study written fro `STAT234: Sequential Decision Making` on using intelligent agents to optimally select training data so as to maximize performance over  several subtasks in the data simultaneously.
    
- **A fast filtering algorithm for massive context-free grammars (2020)**

    An algorithm describing a highly effective practical filter-based solution to parsing with massive context-free grammars
    
- **Generating novel fruits from text descriptions using Variational Autoencoders (2020)**

    A paper written for `NEURO240: Biological and Artificial Intelligence` presenting an attempt to use VAE's and language models to map textual descriptions of fruits to novel images.
    
- **Using generative adversarial networks to generate fake mouse movements (2020)**

    A paper written for `CS263: Computer security` describing an attempt to use GANs to produce fake mouse movements as well as an assessment of the quality of various approaches.
    
- **Perfectly Private Contact Tracing (2020)**
 
    An attempt to improve some of the shortcomings of the DP3T secure contact tracing protocol written for `CS227: Introduction to Cryptography`.
    
- **Noise-skipping Earley parsing and in-order tree extraction from shared packed parse forests (2020)**

    My undergraduate thesis submitted to the departments of Computer Science and Linguistics on a novel algorithm for noise-skipping Earley parsing as well as in-order tree extraction from shared-packed parse forests.
